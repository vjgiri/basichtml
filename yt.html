            <h3>This is a blog post!</h3>
            <p>This will show up as the text for my blog post. It will be styled, by default, to be a normal font size, which makes it good "reading" text -- the kind that you might find in a paragraph in a book.</p>
            <p>You can use paragraph elements as much as you need, and sometimes you may want to style the text within an element. You can do that by using a span element.</p>
            <p>It's easiest to think about "highlighting" text with a span. <span style="background-color:rgb(89, 137, 241);">If you wanted just this text to be yellow, you could use a span to do that!</span></p>
            <p>Now, let's say we want to add a list of things to do or instructions on how to do something in this blog post. We could add an unordered list for our to-do list, and we could add an ordered lists for our instructions. Let's try it.</p>
            <h3>My To-Do List</h3> 
            <ul>         
                <li>Test out the Typography and Flow of HTML elements</li>
                <li>Take a nap</li>
                <li>Keep coding!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The First 3 Steps to Troubleshoot Any Tech Issue</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Turn off the device.</li>
                <li>Turn the device back on.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 1 and 2.</li>
            </ol>

               <li><a href="https://covalence.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can also add hyperlinks inside of other elements! Like this. Since we used the "target" attribute with the value "_blank", the website will open in a new tab or window. Remember to use the "rel" attribute as well for security concerns!</a></li>
